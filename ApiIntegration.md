## Review, Research, and Discussion

* How do bearer tokens work? 👀 📝
The Bearer Token is created for you by the Authentication server. When a user authenticates your application (client) the authentication server then goes and generates for you a Token.

* Describe express middleware? 👀 📝
Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server.

Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path) it's attached to. 
In fact, Express itself is compromised wholly of middleware functions.

* What is a JWT? 👀 📝
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely 
transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

- JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA. 
- Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens.
- Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties.
- When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, 
the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.
