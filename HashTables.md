## - What is a Hashtable? üëÄ üìù
Terminology:

- Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
- Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
- Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

## Why do we use them? üëÄ üìù
1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Library


## What Are they üëÄ üìù
Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

* **Hash table
Hash table
A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched. By using a good hash function, hashing can work well. Under reasonable assumptions, the average time required to search for an element in a hash table is O(1).
Let us consider string S. You are required to count the frequency of all the characters in this string.**
>>string S = ‚Äúababcd‚Äù

* **The simplest way to do this is to iterate over all the possible characters and count their frequency one by one. The time complexity of this approach is O(26*N) where N is the size of the string and there are 26 possible characters.**
